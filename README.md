- I have downloaded data for all projects from internet some project raw date I have downloaded from Kaggle some data from microsoft website and some data from other sites.
- There are some CSV Files and some excels. Also have used SQL Server as a datasourse.
- First I fetch data into Power BI Desktop then I clean the data in power query editor so done some transformations like remove unnecessary columns,replaced values,created custom columns & conditional columns,
  change data type,column names.
- After transformation I have have created model so have overcome many to many relationship issues, bidirectional relationship issues. Created star schema because we try to avoid snowflake and galaxy schema.
- After modelling created report with multiple pages in than have used different insights like cards, tables, bar charts, column charts, line chart, pie chart, guage chart.
- Also have used some filters, bookmarks,page navigations, custom tooltips, slicers. Created some dax queries for difficult calculations.
- Tried to create more attractive and interactive dashboards.
